Confidential Info Redactor Lite is a Ruby gem to semi-automatically redact confidential information from a text. It is the "lite" version of [Confidential Info Redactor](https://github.com/diasks2/confidential_info_redactor) - the difference being that in this gem no languages are included, you need to supply the vocabulary lists for each language you want to use.

This gem is a poor man's named-entity recognition (NER) library built to extract (and later redact) information in a text (such as proper nouns) that may be confidential. 

It differs from typical NER as it makes no attempt to identify whether a token is a person, company, location, etc. It only attempts to extract tokens that might fit into one of those categories.

Your use case may vary, but the gem was written to first extract potential sensitive tokens from a text and then show the user the extracted tokens and let the user decide which ones should be redacted (or add missing tokens to the list).

The way the gem works is rather simple. It uses regular expressions to search for capitalized tokens (1-grams, 2-grams, 3-grams etc.) and then checks whether those tokens match a list of the common vocabulary for that language (e.g. the x most frequent words - the size of x depending on what is available for that language). If the token is not in the list of words for that language it is added to an array of tokens that should be checked by the user as potential "confidential information".

In the sentence "Pepsi and Coca-Cola battled for position in the market." the gem would extract "Pepsi" and "Coca-Cola" as potential tokens to redact.

In addition to searching for proper nouns, the gem also has the functionality to redact numbers, dates, emails and hyperlinks.
